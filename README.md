# Student project bigint

This is a realization of "long arithmetic", that is, a class (structure) that stores numbers of arbitrary length inside itself and supports basic arithmetic operations with them. Only unsigned integer arithmetic are be supported, i.e. only non-negative numbers are supported.

The solution is formatted as a bigint class.

Also BASE might be changed for some degree of 10.
